# HWID Tool - Hardware Identifier Management Utility

## Overview
A Rust-based hardware identifier management tool designed for privacy-conscious gamers and developers. This utility allows users to modify system identifiers while maintaining **0/70 detections on VirusTotal**, demonstrating clean code practices and legitimate system interaction methods. Created as a proof-of-concept for hardware privacy.

## 🔍 Security Verification
**Status: 0/70 Detections (Clean)**
- **VirusTotal Report**: [View Analysis](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c1e16a1d5ffaef5835e343862520062a118ebf815fe37ab6beac92390881b9bb/detection)
- **SHA-256**: `c1e16a1d5ffaef5835e343862520062a118ebf815fe37ab6beac92390881b9bb`
- **File Size**: 18.821 MB (x64 only)
- **Detection Rate**: Exceptionally low due to proper Rust coding and compilation standards, our private modules are very sophisticated.

## 🚀 Capabilities

### Hardware Identifier Management
- **System ID Adjustment**: Modifies hardware identifiers at multiple system layers
- **Network Identifier Randomization**: Updates MAC addresses across all adapters
- **Storage Serial Management**: Handles GPT/MBR disk identifiers with driver-level access
- **Component ID Configuration**: Manages GPU, CPU, and motherboard identifiers
- **Registry Management**: System-level registry modifications for ID persistence

### Compatibility Testing
Tested in various environments including:
- **EasyAntiCheat** environments (Fortnite, Apex Legends, Rust)
- **Vanguard** systems (will likely require additional configuration)
- **BattlEye** protected titles (Rainbow Six Siege, Escape from Tarkov, PUBG)
- **Ricochet** implementations (Call of Duty series)
- **FACEIT** and other competitive platforms (variable success rates)

### Technical Architecture
- **Language**: Rust with direct system bindings
- **Distribution**: Statically linked, zero runtime dependencies
- **Operation**: Kernel-level access, WMI integration, registry management
- **Persistence Model**: Single execution pattern, no resident processes

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### System Integration Layers
1. **WMI Interface**: Communicates with Win32_DiskDrive, Win32_BaseBoard, Win32_BIOS classes
2. **Registry Layer**: Direct HKLM modifications for system identifier management
3. **Driver Integration**: Kernel-level access for persistent storage modifications
4. **Network Stack**: NDIS layer integration for adapter configuration
5. **PCI System**: Hardware descriptor management via SetupAPI
6. **Evasion Techniques**: Advanced pattern management (compiled components)

### Development Philosophy
Core management logic remains open-source on GitHub, while advanced system integration techniques stay compiled to maintain effectiveness against detection systems. This balanced approach allows community auditing while preserving operational integrity.

## 📥 Installation & Usage

### Recommended Source
**For optimal compatibility and verification:**
- **[hwidspoof.net](https://hwidspoof.net)** - Official distribution with verified checksums
- **Security Note**: Avoid third-party distributions to ensure file integrity

### Alternative Access
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hwspf/hwidtool/releases) - Source components and documentation
- Compiled binaries include both open and proprietary modules

### Compilation Considerations
**This project requires specialized build environments due to:**
- Complex Cargo dependency graphs
- Custom build toolchains and scripts
- Advanced Rust feature requirements
- Specific compiler optimization profiles
- Multiple private code repositories

Unless experienced with Rust ecosystem and Windows driver development, pre-compiled binaries are recommended.

### Usage Protocol
1. **Acquire** the latest build from [hwidspoof.net](https://hwidspoof.net)
2. **Execute** the application
3. **Load configuration** via the interface
4. **Apply modifications** through the management interface
5. **System restart** for full identifier propagation
6. **Verification** using standard system information tools

## 🔍 Project Components

### Open Source (MIT Licensed)
